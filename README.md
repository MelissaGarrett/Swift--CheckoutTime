# Swift--CheckoutTime
A personal app to keep a list of the books I wish to checkout from the public library in the future.

The first tableview is a list of genres from which I regularly choose books from.
The second tableview is a list of books separated by genre.

A local alert will pop up on the 1st day of every month signaling it's time to check out a new book. I will then go in the app
and choose which book I'd like to read next while also making sure the local library has it available for borrowing.
After downloading the book onto my personal device, I will "check out" (delete) the book from this app.
